This is a Shiny web app for interacting with [IPEDS data](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/login.aspx?gotoReportId=1). 

The dashboard is [here](https://jrf1111.shinyapps.io/IPEDS-peer-comparison-shiny).

All resources are available from [the project's GitHub repo](https://github.com/jrf1111/IPEDS-peer-comparison-shiny).

Early versions of this were largely based on [a project by Suraj Malpani](https://github.com/SurajMalpani/Shiny_H1b) and [the accompanying blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/plotly-with-r-shiny-495f19f4aba3).
